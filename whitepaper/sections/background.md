1. Background

While cryptocurrencies introduced a solution to the problem of digital scarcity and enumeration, they have failed to create sustainable incentives for the developers that participate in them.

In this paper we introduce a cryptocurrency that rewards and provisions open-source software, as well as a platform for establishing trust & transparency in open source communities.

a. Cryptocurrencies and money

The invention of digital scarcity made it possible to economically incentivize and remunerate network participants for their service in a simple & transparent way, without mediation by a trusted third-party. The introduction of Bitcoin, and later Ethereum, led to an explosion of alternative cryptocurrencies that primarily compete on a) network utility and b) monetary policy of the economy that they provision.

If Bitcoin sought to reward network operators for their service in validating transactions, other projects such as Zcash and Dash extended that reward to incentivize value producers in their networks in order to further stimulate their economy. Despite most of these experiments, till today, no cryptocurrency has succeeded in creating sustainable incentives for developers that want to participate on their networks, either directly by contributing to the protocol or indirectly by contributing to the open source infrastructure that underlies it.

The problem is just another instance of the challenges associated with the incentivization of free and open source software, that have been broadly discussed and studied in literature.

b. Developer incentives and the problem of open-source software sustainability

To further motivate this work, we must first familiarize ourselves with the conditions in which free and open-source software is developed. Software whose source code is publicly available is called open-source. Most of the software we use on a daily basis relies on free and public code. In an increasingly digitized society, these open-source projects have become the foundation of digital infrastructure underpinning many of our societal goods and services.

With the emergence of software hosting sites like GitHub and community sites like Stack Overflow, the open-source paradigm became the focal point of software development, resulting in the development of numerous high quality projects which are openly available for anyone to use. This phenomenon helped companies (a) to reduce lead times and bring products to the market faster and (b) to recruit talent from a new pool of technologists, educated on the basis of open-source software.

Today, many open-source projects are started by individuals or small groups of people solving a personally, socially, or technically relevant problem. By analysing people's motivations for participating in open-source software development the following themes emerge: (a) pride in one's work, (b) reputation, (c) learning, (d) responsibility for something they believe in,(e) being part of a community and (f) financial compensation.

While most open-source software projects start for the reasons above, the ones that gain momentum require significant resources in time and money to maintain. This creates a fundamental problem: projects created in the spare time of a developer are becoming critical public infrastructure. While some developers find ways to sustainably finance their efforts, most developers, as their projects gain popularity, experience stress and exhaustion trying to keep up with the requests of the community during their free time, often abandoning their own projects or burning out under the increased responsibility. Left unchecked, this leads to a tragedy of the commons which is at the core of the problem this paper attempts to address: financial sustainability and transparency in the development of open-source software

c. The linked structure in open-source software

While the importance of an open-source software package is highly subjective to each individual, valuable information about its relative importance can be extracted by studying the structure of open-source software through dependencies.

Similarly to how Google pioneered a large-scale search engine around PageRank that takes advantage of the present structure in hypertext (the web) in order to organize the worldâ€™s information, the linked graph of open-source software dependencies offers an important resource when it comes to information extraction, that can be thought of as an implicit form of implicit trust present in the structure.
